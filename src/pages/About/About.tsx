                    Nakshatra is the official Astronomy and Science club at National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NITT).
                    We are constantly on the lookout for stargazing, simulations and blogging! From our flagship festival, Stardust to our everyday debates,
                    Nakshatra makes for an amazing place to hang out with space enthusiasts.
                    Our mission is to create enthusiasm and delight in Astronomy and Science by conducting various workshops and sky mapping sessions throughout the year.
                    This, combined with our blogs, helps us expand the reach of the subject while simultaneously creating appreciation for the scientists and engineers in the field.
